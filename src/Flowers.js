        1800Flowers is an ecommerce company dealing mainly in flowers, but also owns other food based brands,
        such as Harry and David. I worked on their multi-brand portal, a single react app which encompasses all of their
        brands at once. My work there included building out UI, adding GA tags, adding new features, and working on a self-service portal.
